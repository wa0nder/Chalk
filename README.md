# Chalk
2020

Warning: this project is in an initial stage of development so anything is up for change.

Purpose: create a comment thread system with ReactJS where components update themselves using a local database synced with remote database.

It is created in the spirit of a 'CouchApp'* where the website files are attached to the CouchDB database and served from there.

The updateScriptNodeJS.js file is meant to be run with NPM to upload any changed files to a local CouchDB instance.

*the concept of a 'CouchApp' has been officially abandoned by the CouchDB development team, see here: https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/ddocs/
