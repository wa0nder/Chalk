# Chalk
2020

Warning: this project is in an initial stage of development so anything is up for change.

Associated ramblings and technical decisions for this project can be read at my site here: https://www.clarityncode.com/p/1-first-steps.html

Purpose: create a comment thread system with ReactJS where components update themselves using a local database synced with remote database.

It is created in the spirit of a 'CouchApp'* where the website files are attached to the CouchDB database and served from there.

The updateScriptNodeJS.js file can be run with NPM to upload any changed files to a local CouchDB instance.

*the concept of a 'CouchApp' has been officially abandoned by the CouchDB development team, see here: https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/ddocs/


Roadmap

* Explore and implement technical skeleton of application (software to use, API's to call, authentication scheme, etc.)
.
.
* Architect the overall structure of the program (object organization, begin unit tests, etc.)
.
.
* Analyze the user experience both from a front-end styling perspective and back-end technical maintenance
